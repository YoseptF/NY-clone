This is our take on the New York Times article page, but made only with pure HTML and CSS, we struggled a little positioning elements using float, given that event the NYT uses flexbox, but it was a really great exercise, we learned a lot. The original site can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0).
